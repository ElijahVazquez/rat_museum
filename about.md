      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>The R.A.T. Museum exists to celebrate creativity in its smallest, most accessible forms. We believe art shouldn’t be locked behind ticket prices, gallery walls, or exclusive spaces. It should be free, local, and easy to stumble upon. Small work can still move people—it’s personal, approachable, and easy to share with neighbors.</p>

      <p>By showcasing miniature pieces from local artists, students, and community members, we create a simple public art stop that invites people to slow down, lean in, and notice the details.</p>

      <h2>How It Started</h2>
      <p>In 2025 I was sketching ideas for a small public art project in Ridgedale. I kept circling the same thought: tiny things make people stop. Tiny Doors ATL, Little Free Libraries, miniature gardens. There is something about small, unexpected art that pulls people in and makes a neighborhood feel cared for.</p>

      <p>The idea clicked: what if Ridgedale had its own little burst of joy, something you could stumble across on a walk, peek into, and feel connected to your neighbors for a moment? A tiny museum felt like the perfect fit: playful, approachable, and easy for both kids and adults to contribute to.</p>

      <p>Sharing early mockups with neighbors confirmed it. People lit up. Teachers wanted their classrooms involved. Artists offered pieces. Before the physical build was even finished, the community support was already there.</p>

      <h2>The Space</h2>
      <p>The R.A.T. Museum is a small, weatherproof gallery designed for outdoor public art. It will be installed in the <strong>Buckley Street</strong> median along the greenway and mounted on a sturdy post so it can be viewed safely from the path.</p>

      <p>Inside, the museum is built like a miniature gallery. The walls are bright white, the floor is dark hardwood, and there is simple molding to mimic a real exhibition space. The interior panels are removable and secured with hidden magnets so artwork can be swapped quickly without damaging anything. A clear acrylic window seals the front and keeps the elements out. Solar LED lighting will illuminate the exhibits at night and make the space visible even on cloudy days.</p>

      <p>The overall footprint is small but intentional. The scale invites people to lean in, slow down, and take a closer look. It is built to feel like a real museum in miniature, a tiny place to discover something new on an ordinary walk through the neighborhood.</p>

      <h2>Exhibition Process</h2>
      <p>We aim to rotate exhibitions roughly once a quarter, with shorter pop-ups in between when there’s community demand. Exhibits will feature:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Local artists</strong> experimenting with small-scale work</li>
        <li><strong>Students</strong> from nearby schools and art programs</li>
        <li><strong>Community members</strong> of all ages and experience levels</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Most pieces will be between 2&quot;x2&quot; and 4&quot;x4&quot;. Mediums include watercolor, acrylic, ink, block prints, collage, tiny sculpture, and poetry cards. If more artists want to participate than will fit at once, we’ll rotate the work in sets so everyone gets their moment on display.</p>

      <h2>Want to Exhibit?</h2>
      <p>We’re always looking for tiny art. If you’ve never shown your work before, this is a low-pressure way to start. If you’re an established artist, it’s a fun creative challenge. Send a note and we’ll share sizing tips and upcoming open slots.</p>
