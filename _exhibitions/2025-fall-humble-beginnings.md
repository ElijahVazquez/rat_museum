A small collection of pieces made at different points in my life. Some were created with friends around the table, others on quiet nights at home. A few started as simple block prints and found new life when I transferred them onto tiny canvases. Others came from experiments with acrylics or my first attempt at watercolor. None of it was planned as a body of work, but together these little pieces mark the early steps of figuring out what making art even means to me.

## Artist Reflections

_"I took on the challenge of building the first R.A.T. Museum, but I never expected to have artwork of my own inside it. The positive reactions to both the museum itself and my pieces have been humbling. I’ve never thought of myself as a ‘real’ artist—too shy, too full of doubt to even try. This whole process reminded me that sometimes you just do the thing anyway, even when it feels scary or uncertain."_ — **E.V.**
