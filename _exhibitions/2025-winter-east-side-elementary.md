This exhibition features artwork created by a group of elementary school students from right here in Ridgedale. The pieces range from bold abstract paintings to imaginative mixed-media experiments. Some students worked in teams, others worked independently, but every piece carries that familiar spark of childhood creativity — the kind that feels big, fearless, and wonderfully unfiltered.

This is the first installment of what we hope will become an ongoing series with East Side Elementary. As more students express interest, future classes will have their turn to take over the tiny museum and share their work with the neighborhood.

## About the Artists

These young artists come from **East Side Elementary School**, bringing their energy, curiosity, and imagination to the R.A.T. Museum. For many of them, this is the first time their art has been shown outside the classroom. Guided by their art teacher, the students explored color, shape, storytelling, and whatever ideas felt fun or meaningful to them in the moment.

- **Medium:** Mixed media, acrylic, watercolor, marker, collage
- **Size:** 2"x2" to 4"x4"

## Student Reflections

_“I didn’t know paint could do that.”_  
_“This one is about my cat, but also space.”_  
_“I wanted it to look like fireworks but also a dragon.”_
