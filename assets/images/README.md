# Exhibition Images

Place your exhibition images in this directory.

## Image Guidelines

- **Format:** JPG, PNG, or GIF
- **Naming:** Use descriptive names (e.g., miniature-landscapes.jpg)
- **Size:** Optimize for web (aim for under 500KB per image)
- **Dimensions:** Recommended minimum width: 800px

## Adding Images to Exhibitions

1. Place your image file in this directory
2. Edit the exhibition file in _exhibitions/
3. Update the image: field in the front matter:

```yaml
image: "/assets/images/your-image-name.jpg"
```

## Temporary Placeholder

Until you add real images, you can use placeholder services:
